<h1>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h1>
In this project , I have used 'Pandas' , 'Plotly' , 'Cufflinks' , 'Beautiful Soup' and 'Requests' Library to create a Web Scrapping Program.
My project works as follows :

- Obtain the data(link) from which I want to extract data. 
- Made a HTTP request (using 'requests' library) to the webpage associated with my link which returned a response object with all the requested data.
- Parsed the HTML content of the response object using Beauriful Soup.
- Inspected the web page associated with my link to decide what to extract and wrote code for the same.
- Got the values for all the products and stored them into Lists.
- Created a Dataframe using all those lists using Pandas.
- Visualised the data using Plotly and Cufflinks.

<h1>WEB SCRAPPING</h1>

Web scraping is the process of collecting structured web data in an automated fashion. It’s also called web data extraction. Some of the main use cases of web scraping include price monitoring, price intelligence, news monitoring, lead generation, and market research among many others.

In general, web data extraction is used by people and businesses who want to make use of the vast amount of publicly available web data to make smarter decisions.

If you’ve ever copied and pasted information from a website, you’ve performed the same function as any web scraper, only on a microscopic, manual scale. Unlike the mundane, mind-numbing process of manually extracting data, web scraping uses intelligent automation to retrieve hundreds, millions, or even billions of data points from the internet’s seemingly endless frontier.
